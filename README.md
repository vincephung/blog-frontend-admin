# Blog-frontend-admin

Frontend view of the admin's control of the blog project.

## Description
This is a full stack blog built using the MERN stack that uses the REST API back end that I created.
There are three parts to this project, backend, admin frontend and user frontend. This is the admin frontend.
The difference in this view is that an admin user is able to log-in and make changes to blog posts.
My main focus on this part of the project was to follow the CRUD principles, which allows the admin to create, read, update and delete posts.

Here are the links to the other parts:

### Admin User Functionality
* Logged in admin users can create, read, update and delete posts.
* If a non-admin tries to do any of these, it will give back an error.


## Technologies used
* MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
* HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JavaScript
