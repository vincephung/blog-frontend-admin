## Blog-frontend-admin

Frontend view of the admin's control of the blog project.

Using the REST API Built in the backend, an admin user is able to follow CRUD.

Logged in admin users can create, read, update and delete posts.

If a non-admin tries to do any of these, it will give back an error.

Built using react and express/nodejs.

I mainly focused on getting the rest api to work and did not stress on the actual aesthetics of the website.
